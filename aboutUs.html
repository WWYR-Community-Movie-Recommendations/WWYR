        <p id="name">Melo "Melodic"</p>

        <p>Background:</p>
        <p id="background-info">I come from a background in small business primarily in providing clients with tax and business services. 

        <p>Why I chose to pursue software development: </p>
        <p>My passion for technology and how things work led me to pursue learning software development. In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering with tech-related projects and continually expanding my skills and knowledge. Recognizing the value of software development in enhancing my offerings to clients, I have officially embarked on a journey with Code Fellows to deepen my expertise. While my direction may evolve as I gather more knowledge, my experience in small business management and leadership has honed my ability to independently complete tasks and effectively plan and prioritize.</p> 

        <p>Goals: </p>
        <p>My goal now is to acquire extensive knowledge in software development and explore the opportunities that await on this exciting journey.</p>
